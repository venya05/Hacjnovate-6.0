Features: 
MRI-Based Detection: Users can upload their structural MRI scans to receive insights through a binary classification model that predicts the likelihood of autism. This feature promotes data-driven evaluation, complementing traditional behavioral assessments.

Ask Anything About Autism: This section allows users to ask questions and clarify doubts about autism through an AI-powered chatbot deployed using the Akash Network. It promotes awareness and delivers accurate information while maintaining user privacy through decentralized hosting.

Online Therapy: A dynamic questionnaire-driven module that uses Agent.AI to generate tailored therapy suggestions and  day-to-day routines, helping users manage challenges in a structured and supportive manner.

Results :
1) online therapy
2)  Take test 
3) ask Anything
4) Autism Detection through sMRI analysis
